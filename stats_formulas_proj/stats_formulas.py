Topic Highlight in Data Science from scratch - Chapter 5 Statistics - covariance and correlation.

This topic is explained in the math - 2, std 12th chapter 3 - Linear Regression  
Correlation is used to measure the strength and direction of association between 2 variables.

Correlation coefficient measures association between 2 variables but cannot determine 
the value of one variable when the value of the other variable is known or given.
The technique used for predicting the value of one variable for a given value of the other
variable is called regression. Regression is a statistical tool for investigating the relationship
between variables. 
NOTE: Karl Pearson defined the coefficient of correlation known as Pearsonâ€™s
Product Moment correlation coefficient.

Note: Some statistical methods attempt to determine the value of an unknown quantity,
which may be a parameter or a random variable. The method used for this purpose is
called estimation if the unknown quantity is a parameter, and prediction if the unknown
quantity is a variable.

Linear Regression
Linear regression is a method of predicting the value of one variable when the values of
all other variables are known or specified. -
